The Adaptive LSAT Study Planner is a web application that generates a personalized, data-driven study schedule for LSAT students. It uses user inputs to dynamically create and continuously adjust a study plan. Unlike static study calendars, this system adapts based on performance trends, timing data, and section accuracy.
